## RPI Monitor

A simple data visualization tool for the Raspberry - write your own python script to monitor whichever data you can think of.

![Sample Monitors](https://raw.github.com/skarbat/rpi-monitor/master/screenshots/rpimonitor-sample.png)

rpi-monitor sits transparently above GUI applications without disturbing their visibility.

To run the monitor, `sudo systemctl enable rpi-monitor` and/or `rpi-monitor-bcm`, then start manually or reboot the PI.
